# Hi, I'm Cameron Portis 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm an Undergraduate Cybersecurity Intern with a passion for developing innovative tools and incorporating the latest technologies to enhance the cybersecurity landscape.

## 🔧 Technologies & Tools

Here are some of the technologies and tools I frequently work with:

- Programming Languages: Python, C, Java
- Operating Systems: Windows and Linux
- Tools: Langchain, Wireshark, Virtualbox

## 🌟 Featured Projects

Here are some of my notable projects:

1. **Large Language Models for Alert Investigation**  
   Led the development of a cutting-edge application using OpenAI's API and a large language model architecture based on retrieval-augmented generation to address alert fatigue in security operations centers. The project focused on enhancing the efficiency of log data analysis and exploring the limitations of these advanced models in the alert investigation process.

2. **Large Language Models for Penetration Testing**  
   Contributed significantly to a thorough review of large language models tailored to streamline the penetration testing process. This project aimed to develop a new framework and model that would support the growth of open-source security testing solutions, evaluating current models to advance more effective and widely accessible tools for penetration testing.
