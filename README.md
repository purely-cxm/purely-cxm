# Hi, I'm Cameron Portis 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm an Undergraduate Cybersecurity Engineering Intern with a passion for developing innovative tools and incorporating the latest technologies to enhance the cybersecurity landscape and elevate the entire security enterprise.

## 🔧 Technologies & Tools

Here are some of the technologies and tools I frequently work with:

- Programming Languages: Python, C, Java
- Operating Systems: Windows and Linux
- Tools: Langchain, Wireshark, Virtualbox

## 🌟 Featured Projects

Here are some of my notable projects:
(Please be advised that certain projects in my portfolio are proprietary and not available for public viewing.)

1. **Large Language Models for Alert Investigation**  
   Led the development of a cutting-edge application using OpenAI's API and a large language model architecture based on retrieval-augmented generation to address alert fatigue in security operations centers. The project focused on enhancing the efficiency of log data analysis and exploring the limitations of these advanced models in the alert investigation process.

2. **Large Language Models for Penetration Testing**  
   Contributed significantly to a thorough review of large language models tailored to streamline the penetration testing process. This project aimed to develop a new framework and model that would support the growth of open-source security testing solutions, evaluating current models to advance more effective and widely accessible tools for penetration testing.

## 🌱 I’m currently learning

I'm currently working on improving my skills in **Langchain** and integrations with **artificial intelligence**. I am also working on enhancing my skills in network analysis, incident response and other tasks required in cyberoperations.

## 🤝 I’m open to collaboration

I'm interested in collaborating on projects related to cybersecurity, innovative tool development, and designing architectures to enhance the proficiency of future development.
